----- Begin Fatal Exception 15-Feb-2023 22:22:41 CET-----------------------
An exception of category 'DictionaryNotFound' occurred while
   [0] Constructing the EventProcessor
   [1] Calling ProductRegistry::initializeLookupTables, checking dictionaries for consumed products
Exception Message:
No data dictionary found for the following classes:

  edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCStripHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> >
  edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCWireHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> >
  edm::Wrapper<edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCStripHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> > >
  edm::Wrapper<edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCWireHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> > >

Most likely each dictionary was never generated, but it may
be that it was generated in the wrong package. Please add
(or move) the specification '<class name="whatever"/>' to
the appropriate classes_def.xml file along with any other
information needed there. For example, if this class has any
transient members, you need to specify them in classes_def.xml.
Also include the class header in classes.h

The list of types above was generated while checking for
dictionaries related to products declared to be consumed.
A type listed above might or might not be a type declared
to be consumed. Instead it might be the type of a data member,
base class, wrapped type or other object needed by a consumed
type.  Below is some additional information which lists
the types declared to be consumed by a module and which
are associated with the types whose dictionaries were not
found:

  edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCStripHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCStripHit> >
  edm::RangeMap<CSCDetId,edm::OwnVector<CSCWireHit,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> >,edm::ClonePolicy<CSCWireHit> >
